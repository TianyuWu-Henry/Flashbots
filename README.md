# Public or Private Venue: A Game-Theoretical Analysis of Blockchain Network Layer Dynamics

## Overview

The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to comprehensively investigate how miners, users, and arbitragers (equivalent to validators and builders, users, and searchers after the Merge) in the Ethereum blockchain would choose between adopting the public mempool or private mempool by taking both economic incentives and behavioral concepts. By applying game theory principles, we aim to understand the strategic interactions between these players and identify potential equilibrium states.

## Features

- Game-theoretical modeling: Implementing models and algorithms to simulate the behavior of users, miners, and arbitragers in different scenarios.
- Payoff calculations: Defining and calculating payoffs for each player based on their chosen strategies and the outcomes of transactions.
- Equilibrium analysis: Identifying potential equilibria and analyzing the stability and optimality of these states.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Data]([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A8N4WOZUgshCMg8u78jZHc2-JlojJ7fY?usp=sharing]): Cleaned On-chain and Flashbots Data
